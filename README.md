# DFT
Basic Eigensolver for the Kohm Sham equations using scipy, numpy and pandas, currently only uses an LDA exchange correlation functional

What I want for the project
*Implementing plotting in spherical coordinates of the charge density
*Improvement of self confistent field methods i.e. when the iterations of the eigensolver should be halted, the limits of integration
*A full array of Exc functionals
*Neural network of any kind for the calculation of the best Exc functional
*Currently only the energies are calculated,any other observables should be benefitial
*Including more than one nucleus
*Possibility for polyatomic molecules
